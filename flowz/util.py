class LastResult(object):
    """
    Wrap a function into an iterative consumer of its own output.

    Given callables `func` and `first`, the `LastResult` object will act as a callable.

    On first call, it will pass call parameters through to `first`, returning the
    result.

    Subsequent calls will pass call parameters through to `func`, but with the result
    of the previous invocation included as the final positional parameter.

    So, for instance:

        f = LastResult(lambda a, l: a + l, lambda a: a)

        # returns 10 (lambda a: a)
        f(10)

        # returns 11 (lambda a, l: a + l, with a 1 and l 10)
        f(1)

        # returns 13 (a is 2, l is 11 from previous call)
        f(2)

    The `first` callable is optional; when not given, `func` is called for all
    invocations, but for the very first call, the constant `flowz.util.NO_VALUE` is
    used in place of the nonexistent previous result.

    The following would give exactly the same behavior as before:

        f = LastResult(lambda a, l: a if l is NO_VALUE else a + l)

    Enjoy your stateful callable.  May it serve you well.
