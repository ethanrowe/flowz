# Overview

_Read the code, buddy._

## Development

For development, we'll give the [git flow strategy](http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/) a try.

Do all features on feature branches named appropriately.

The "develop" branch receives new features.

Release branches will get features for assembling a new release.

Release branches will get merged into "master"; "master" should remain in a clean state (tests passing, releaseable).
